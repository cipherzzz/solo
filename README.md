See the relevant output requested in the respective `responses, sql, and types` directory. 

## Responses
I used screenshots from the app to arrive at these `action` specific structures in the `responses` directory.

## Interfaces
I used `typescript` to construct the interfaces for the models in the `types` directory.

## SQL
I used `pseudo` code to contruct the queries in the `sql` directory. The joins are definitely not correct and the `in` operator is probably not the best, but I didn't have time to create the ddls to optimize.
